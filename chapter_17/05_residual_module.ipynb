        "## How to Implement the Residual Module\n",
        "The Residual Network, or ResNet, architecture for convolutional neural networks was proposed\n",
        "by Kaiming He, et al. in their 2016 paper titled Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition,\n",
        "which achieved success on the 2015 version of the ILSVRC challenge (introduced in Chapter 15).\n",
        "A key innovation in the ResNet was the residual module. The residual module, specifically the\n",
        "identity residual model, is a block of two convolutional layers with the same number of filters\n",
        "and a small filter size where the output of the second layer is added with the input to the first\n",
        "convolutional layer. Drawn as a graph, the input to the module is added to the output of the\n",
        "module and is called a shortcut connection. We can implement this directly in Keras using the\n",
        "functional API and the add() merge function."

        "often referred to as a projection layer, to either increase the number of filters for the input\n",
