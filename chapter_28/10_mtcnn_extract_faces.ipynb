        "titled Joint Face Detection and Alignment Using Multitask Cascaded Convolutional Networks.\n",
        "The MTCNN is popular because it achieved then state-of-the-art results on a range of benchmark\n",
        "datasets, and because it is capable of also recognizing other facial features such as eyes and\n",
        "mouth, called landmark detection.\n",
        "The network uses a cascade structure with three networks; first the image is rescaled to a\n",
        "range of different sizes (called an image pyramid), then the first model (Proposal Network or\n",
        "P-Net) proposes candidate facial regions, the second model (Refine Network or R-Net) filters the\n",
