        "The MTCNN is popular because it achieved then state-of-the-art results on a range of benchmark\n",

        "range of different sizes (called an image pyramid), then the first model (Proposal Network or\n",
        "P-Net) proposes candidate facial regions, the second model (Refine Network or R-Net) filters the\n",
